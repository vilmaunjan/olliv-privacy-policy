    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 11-12-2025</p>
        <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Olliv Studios</p>
        <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:help.ollivstudios@gmail.com">help.ollivstudios@gmail.com</a></p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Olliv Studios (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application
        (“the App”) handles information and protects your data when you use it.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information such as your name, email
        address, phone number, or contact details. All recipe generation and saving features operate locally on your device
        or through third-party services that process data temporarily to provide functionality.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Information the App May Process</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>User Inputs:</strong> When you type text into the recipe generator, that text is sent securely to
            Google’s Gemini AI model to create your recipe. This input is processed temporarily and is not stored by Olliv Studios.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Local Storage:</strong> If you save a recipe, it is stored locally on your device using a local Room
            database. We do not have access to your saved recipes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Services:</strong> The App may use Firebase (by Google) for limited purposes such as
            performance monitoring, crash reporting, or remote configuration. These services may collect non-personal
            technical information (such as device type, app version, and crash logs) in accordance with
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Use of AI Services</h2>
    <p>
        Our recipe generation feature uses Google’s Gemini model through Google Cloud AI services. While we do not request
        personal data, any information you enter (including names or other details) may be processed temporarily to
        generate results. If you prefer not to have your input processed by AI, you can refrain from using the recipe
        generation feature.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Olliv Studios does not store user data on its own servers. All saved recipes remain on your device and are removed
        if you uninstall the app or clear its data. AI input is processed temporarily and is not retained after the
        response is generated.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We use secure communication with Firebase and follow industry-standard security practices to protect app data.
        Because all saved data remains on your device, your information is primarily under your control.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>
        You may delete all locally stored data at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing its data from your device
        settings. If you have questions or wish to request information about data processing, you can contact us at
        <a href="mailto:help.ollivstudios@gmail.com">help.ollivstudios@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or process any personal
        information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted on this page with a new Effective
        Date. Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Policy.
    </p>
